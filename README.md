# üì¶ Inventory Management RESTful API

The system manages supplier purchases, stock storage across multiple warehouses, inter-warehouse transfers, and simulates inventory audits by allowing manual stock adjustments due to surplus, damage, or missing items.

## üì¶ Key Features

#### üîë Authentication & Authorization
- Secured using JWT with refresh & revoke tokens
- Role information is embedded in tokens for protected route handling
- JWT-based access with roles (admin, Inventory Manager, Supplier, Sales Viewer)

#### üßë‚Äçüíº User Management
- Admin can register and manage all users and their roles
- Suppliers can register themselves
- Support for viewing user details and updating profile information

#### üîê Role-Based Access Control
- Roles: `Admin`, `InventoryManager`, `Supplier`, `SalesViewer`
- Admin has full access; in future updates, Inventory Managers will be restricted to their own warehouse

#### üì¶ Product Management
- Products are created by suppliers with base data (name, price, etc.), and extended by the inventory system (barcode, availability)
- Supports full product CRUD operations, bulk creation, and category-based queries

#### üßë‚Äçüíº Supplier Onboarding & Verification
- Suppliers register and upload tax documents for verification by admins
- Only verified suppliers can receive purchase orders or upload products
- A supplier **cannot perform any action** in the system **until verified by an Admin**.

#### üì• Purchase Orders
- Inventory managers and Admin can create purchase orders with multiple products and send them to suppliers
- Purchase orders support multiple statuses: `Draft`, `Sent`, `PartiallyReceived`, `Received`, and `Cancelled`

#### üè¢ Warehouse Management
- Multiple warehouses supported, each with individual inventory levels
- Products can be stored in multiple warehouses with separate stock quantities

#### üîÑ Stock Transfers
- Enables transferring products between warehouses
- Automatically updates inventory records and logs the transfer as a stock movement

#### üõ†Ô∏è Inventory Adjustments (Stock Audit Simulation)
- Allows manual adjustments to stock quantities (e.g., for lost, damaged, or extra items)
- All adjustments are logged in the stock movement history

#### üìä Stock Movement Tracking
- Logs every inventory action (purchase, sale, transfer, manual adjustment) with quantity, date, product, and warehouse details
- Query stock movements by product or warehouse

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:**  
> To follow clean architecture principles and separation of concerns, the Identity-related models like `ApplicationUser` are **not** placed inside the `Domain` layer.  
> Instead, they are defined in the `Infrastructure` layer only, and the relationship (e.g., between `Supplier` and `ApplicationUser`) is configured using **Fluent API** inside `DbContext`.

## üöÄ Technical Features

#### ‚úÖ Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with Refresh Token support
- Role-based authorization using Claims (`Admin`, `Supplier`, `InventoryManager`, `SalesViewer`)
- Centralized user context extraction using custom middleware: [`UserContextMiddleware`](https://github.com/Mahmoudtarek24/InventoryManagement/blob/main/InventoryManagement/Middleware/UserContextMiddleware.cs)
- Relies on [`UserContextService`](https://github.com/Mahmoudtarek24/InventoryManagement/blob/main/Infrastructure/Services/UserContextService.cs) to access `UserId`, `Roles`, `IsSupplier`, `Route` from any layer of the application

#### üß± Architecture & Patterns
- Clean Architecture applied with separation into: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers
- Uses Repository Pattern with Unit of Work for better data handling abstraction
- Dependency Injection is used across the project to manage services and repositories
- Middleware:
  - Global Exception Handling
  - `UserContextMiddleware` to extract and reuse authenticated user info
  - Request locking middleware to prevent duplicate purchase requests in the same minute (admin/inventory manager)

#### üóÑÔ∏è Database Features
- Entity Framework Core as ORM
- Support for both **Soft Delete** (e.g., on Suppliers) and **Hard Delete** where needed
- All entity configurations done through **Fluent API** (example: `CategoryConfigurations`)
- Includes SQL **Views**, such as `SupplierProfileView`, for optimized read access
- Proper indexing and Check constraints applied to ensure data integrity (e.g., `builder.HasCheckConstraint("CK_PurchaseOrder_TotalCost_Positive", "[TotalCost] > 0")`)

#### üß∞ Other Features
- Global Exception Handling with centralized logic
- Custom Action Filters:
  - `ValidateImageAttribute` ‚Äì Validates image file format and size
  - `ValidateModelAttribute` ‚Äì Automatically validates incoming DTOs using FluentValidation
- DTO Validation with **FluentValidation**
- Full API documentation via **Swagger UI**
- Dynamic configuration for image uploads using `IOptions<ImageSettings>` pattern:
- Example:
  ```json
  "ImageSettings": {
    "MaxFileSize": 5242880,
    "AllowedExtensions": [ ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png" ]
  }
  ```
- These settings are strongly typed using a custom `ImageSettings` class and injected using the `IOptions<T>` interface, allowing seamless configuration changes per environment (e.g., development vs production)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Documentation

### ‚öôÔ∏è Database Configuration

- **ORM:** Entity Framework Core
- **Type:** Relational Database
- **Approach:** Code-First
- **Features:**
  - Migrations
  - Relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many)
  - Views
  - Indexing
  - Soft Delete

### üëÅÔ∏è Database Views

##### Purpose & Clean Architecture Compliance
This project implements Clean Architecture principles where:

- **Domain Layer:** Contains core business entities like Supplier and cannot see any other layers
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Contains ApplicationUser (Identity tables) and can see the Domain Layer

##### The Problem:
- Cannot add ApplicationUser as a Navigation Property in Supplier because the Domain Layer cannot see the Infrastructure Layer
- However, we need access to user information related to the supplier

##### The Solution:
Database Views were created to retrieve complete supplier and related user information without violating Clean Architecture principles.

##### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ Maintains Clean Architecture principles
- ‚úÖ Does not violate dependency rules
- ‚úÖ Retrieves complete data in a single query
- ‚úÖ Improves performance
